# Anufy-MusicPlayer-Pure-HTML-CSS

It is kind off hard replica of spotify, which I have made using pure CSS and HTML, the "i" folder contains all the images required for the project.
1 and 2, both of the html and css files basically contains two different ways, the first one is the main layout, while the second one is the view for the playlist.
